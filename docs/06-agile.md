### Agile Iterations

Agile iterations are short, time-boxed cycles—commonly lasting between two and four weeks—designed to deliver
incremental value while enabling continuous learning.

Each iteration includes a clear set of goals, defined by the team in collaboration with stakeholders, and culminates in
delivering working, tested product increments.

Through frequent retrospectives, the team reflect on their process, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting
their approach accordingly.
