## Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) emphasizes customer satisfaction, flexibility, and rapid delivery of high-quality software.

It promotes frequent releases in short development cycles, which 
improves productivity and introduces checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.

Developers work together in pairs and as a group, with simple design and obsessively tested code, improving the design
continually to keep it always just right for the current needs.

See Martin Fowler's article on [Extreme Programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html) for a detailed overview.

### Pair Programming

Pair programming is a software development technique in which two developers work together at one workstation,
reviewing the code in real-time and improving the design continuously.

Developers work in **Pairs**, with one writing the code (the "driver") and the other reviewing each line of code as it
is written (the "observer"). Developers switch roles frequently to ensure that both are engaged and contributing to the
codebase.

Developers can also work in larger groups or **Ensemble**, where the entire team collaborates on the same codebase at
the same time.

These practices promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and immediate feedback, leading to higher quality code and
fewer defects.

### Test-Driven Development

Simple design and obsessively tested code drive the development of the production code in an XP team.

Developers capture lower-level specifications of the behavior of internal system components with clear and 
communicative tests, which are written before the production code itself.


### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices ensure that new features are regularly integrated into
the Product, allowing for swift feedback and adaptation.

Automated build scripts are used to run tests and provide immediate feedback to developers about the status of their
code changes.
