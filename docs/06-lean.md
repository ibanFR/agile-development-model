## Lean Product Management

Lean Product Management outlines key practices that enable teams to deliver value efficiently while maintaining
adaptability.

It emphasizes short iterations—time-boxed cycles that produce potentially shippable product increments and encourage
continuous improvement.

### Short Iterations

Short, time-boxed cycles—commonly lasting between two and four weeks—designed to deliver
incremental value while enabling continuous learning.

Each iteration includes a clear set of goals, defined by the team in collaboration with stakeholders, and culminates in
delivering working, tested product increments.

Through frequent retrospectives, the team reflect on their process, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting
their approach accordingly.


### Information Radiators

Information radiators are highly visible displays that present key project information in an easily accessible and
understandable way, ensuring that everyone—from team members to stakeholders—can quickly grasp the current state of
work.

These visual tools can take many forms, including Scrum or Kanban boards that show work items moving through stages,
burndown or burnup charts that track progress toward goals, and metric dashboards that highlight quality, performance,
or delivery trends.


### Knowledge Base

A knowledge base is a centralized, well-organized repository where teams store information, best practices and technical
guidelines. It serves as the go-to reference for guidance, troubleshooting, and decision-making, ensuring that valuable
knowledge is easily accessible to both current and future team members.

An important aspect of a robust knowledge base is living documentation—documentation that evolves alongside the product.
When documentation is co-located with the codebase and updated in sync with code changes, it remains accurate, relevant,
and immediately useful.

### Customer Feedback

One of the core principles of Agile development is engaging customers early and often throughout the development
process. By seeking input from customers at every stage development teams gain valuable insights that help shape the
direction of the product.

Collecting customer feedback can take many forms: tracking satisfaction metrics, gathering feedback on the quality 
and usefulness of features, and incorporating these insights directly into product and feature design.
