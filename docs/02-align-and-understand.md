## Align and Understand

In order to design, build, and evolve software systems most effectively, our decisions need to create the optimal
business impact, which can only be achieved if we are aligned to the business goals, as well as supporting the users
current and potential future needs.

### Product Brief

Short product or feature brief to frame and constrain the project: 
- Identifies key capabilities and high level goals and objectives of the project.
- Names the different types of users who will use the product. 
- Describes the benefits the organization will gain by building the product.

### Domain Discovery

Spreading domain knowledge through the whole team to create a shared understanding of the system to build. It enables
the developers to build a software system aligned to the domain which can be more flexible to incorporate future
business changes.

Map the Big Picture by describing the User journey through the Product telling a story from the perspective of the end
user.

Focus on getting the whole story. Identify high-level user activities - groups of user tasks that work together to
support a common goal.

### Product Backlog

The product backlog is a prioritized list of user stories that need to be completed to deliver a product or feature.

They typically follow the template: As a **user type/role**, I want **a capability** so that **benefit or goal**.

User stories are not detailed specifications, but rather a placeholder for conversations about the Product to build.
They tell stories about **What** a software system does without revealing details on **How** it does it.
