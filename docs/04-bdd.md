### Requirement Workshop
Specification workshop is a technique used to elicit and define requirements for software systems.

It is a collaborative approach that brings together stakeholders from different areas of the business to discuss and
agree on the behavior of the system.

The goal is to create a shared understanding of the system's requirements and to identify any potential issues early in
the development process.
