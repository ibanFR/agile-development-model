## Align and Understand

In order to design, build, and evolve software systems most effectively, our decisions need to create the optimal
business impact, which can only be achieved if we are aligned to the business goals, as well as supporting the users
current and potential future needs.

### Product Brief

Short product or feature brief to frame and constrain the project. Identifies key capabilities and high level goals and
objectives of the project.

### Domain Discovery

Spreading domain knowledge through the whole team to create a shared understanding of the system to build. It enables
the developers to build a software system aligned to the domain which can be more flexible to incorporate future
business changes.

#### Map the Big Picture

Focus on getting the whole story. The activities and high-level user tasks that tell the whole story form the backbone
of your story map.

#### Explore

Fill the body of your story map by breaking down larger user tasks into smaller subtasks and details. During this phase
you’ll add cards, split one card into two, rewrite cards, and reorganize them.

Look for variations: What else might users of the system have done?

Look for exceptions: What could go wrong,and what would the user have to do to recover?

#### Slice Out Viable Releases

Slice the first release of your map into three or more delivery phases that allow you and your team to learn fast and
avoid risk.

Opening Game. Builds a “functional walking skeleton” – the simplest possible functional version of the product. Begin
validating performance and scalability.

Mid Game complete all major functionality and makes existing functionality richer and more complete. Continue user
testing and leverage feedback to adjust the product.

End Game refines the product in preparation for release. Continuously assess release readiness based on your release
level product goals.
