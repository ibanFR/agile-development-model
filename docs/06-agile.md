## Agile Product Management

### Agile Iterations

Agile iterations are short, time-boxed cycles—commonly lasting between two and four weeks—designed to deliver
incremental value while enabling continuous learning.

Each iteration includes a clear set of goals, defined by the team in collaboration with stakeholders, and culminates in
delivering working, tested product increments.

Through frequent retrospectives, the team reflect on their process, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting
their approach accordingly.


### Information Radiators

Information radiators are highly visible displays that present key project information in an easily accessible and
understandable way, ensuring that everyone—from team members to stakeholders—can quickly grasp the current state of
work.

These visual tools can take many forms, including Scrum or Kanban boards that show work items moving through stages,
burndown or burnup charts that track progress toward goals, and metric dashboards that highlight quality, performance,
or delivery trends.
