# Agile Software Development Model for efficient Product feature delivery

## Context

The "Agile Software Development Model for efficient Product feature delivery" is a dynamic and iterative approach to 
delivering product features in a rapid and flexible manner.

The model is based on the Agile principles and is designed to be used by software development teams to deliver Product
Features in an efficient manner. Rooted in collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback, it emphasizes iterative
development cycles, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. 

Teams work closely together, including developers, designers, and domain experts, to prioritize tasks and deliver 
incremental value with each iteration. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices ensure that new 
features are regularly integrated into the product, allowing for swift feedback and adaptation.

Through frequent retrospectives, teams reflect on their process, identifying areas for improvement and
adjusting their approach accordingly. This iterative cycle fosters a responsive and customer-centric development
environment, where product features are delivered efficiently, meeting evolving user needs and market demands.
